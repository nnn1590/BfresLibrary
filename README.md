# BfresLibrary
A reworked version of NintenTools.Bfres with Wii U and Switch support and many various improvements/features.

## Features
- Support for nearly all bfres versions for Wii U and Switch platforms.
- Merged library code for WiiU and Switch platforms for easy access and conversion.
- Support for accessing shader parameters.
- In library swizzle methods to access deswizzled textures. (Note these are not decoded and will not output RGBA8 data, must be done by external code).
- Many various improvements and bug fixes to the previous NintenTools library.
- Almost full conversion between Wii U and Switch binaries. Materials have to either use a custom conversion profile like `BfresLibrary/PlatformConverters/Presets` or use the original switch materials in the place. [An example of this conversion process.](https://github.com/KillzXGaming/BfresPlatformConverter)

## Planned
- Improve visibily animation support. Boolean bits have issues on some animations.
- Add text conversion for all sections.
- Use an updated binary data version.
- Cleanup the read/writing code. It's quite a mess due to using various platforms and versions. Some things are adjusted to improve speed and performances and also to mantain accuarcy with the ordering and handling of some structures.
